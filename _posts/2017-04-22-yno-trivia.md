What “non-existent” wine did Ellen Barkin offer Matt Damon in _Oceans 13_? Where does _Gruner Veltliner_ come from? These questions and more are answered by [Yno Wine Trivia](https://www.amazon.com/Brainstorm-Creative-Wine-Trivia/dp/B071Y1HRP1/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1503377224&sr=1-1&keywords=wine+trivia). A fun Alexa skill to play with friends or study for WSET, Sommelier, or CSW tests.

## Curiosity and Study
“How do I learn more about wine?” As a wine educator I've encountered this question more times than I can remember. The problem is wine is a daunting subject. I often refer to it as the world‘s 2nd oldest profession. It‘s history, viticulture, and production go back centuries. So, where does one start to get a taste of what it‘s like to learn about wine?

> From my own journey with wine I’ve found that large part of it’s enjoyment starts with education

## Alexa-fied
Voice-enabled digital assistants are fast becoming the next consumer must-have. Amazon's Alexa is an industry leader. The simple act of asking a question without reaching for a mobile device or tapping a keyboard breaks down barriers for software developers. In addition, Alexa's built-in trivia skill makes it even easier. I could not build an app like Yno Wine Trivia as fun and compelling without Alexa. Nor could I build it as fast.
