I’m happy to announce that my 2nd Alexa app has been approved called [Yno Wine Facts](https://www.amazon.com/Brainstorm-Creative-Wine-Facts/dp/B06ZZ44FC1/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1494093108&sr=1-1&keywords=wine+facts). It has much of the same info as [Wine Trivia](https://www.amazon.com/Brainstorm-Creative-Wine-Trivia/dp/B071Y1HRP1/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1494096428&sr=1-1&keywords=wine+trivia) (which I announced last week), but just in a daily fact format vs. a quiz.

## The Wine Journey

As a life long wine enthusiast and certified wine educator, I can tell you that the more you know about wine… the more there is to know about wine. Exploring and learning about wine is a lifelong journey–but, oh what a journey! I have taken many vacations to various wine destinations, well, because they are generally in beautiful places I want to go to anyway. I read about wine history because it can be as riveting as any novel. I enjoy tasting wine… need I explain further.

Then there is the wine business, which is my travail. As I’ve alluded to in some of my other blog posts, it can be a challenging and confounding industry. Consumers are by-and-large unaware of all the crazy regulations, agricultural sensitivities, wealthy egos, and distribution politics that makes discovering wine difficult and confusing. There doesn’t seem to be much correlation between price and quality. There is no guarantee of consistency. There is this crazy expert ratings system, and great disparity in availability depending on where one lives. Understanding your own palette and translating that into what and where to purchase is one of the most common topics discussed in the tasting room. So, that is what I plan to address in this blog as well as my wine products. Starting with…

## Education

Start here. How and where grapes are grown, how wine is made, it’s history, these are all topics covered in my Alexa apps as well as this blog. Education is a start. How to read a label, knowing what wine varietals and styles regions are known for. Information goes a long way towards helping you wend your way through a wine aisle… without fear. Education is much more valuable than ratings. 100 point systems are nothing more than one person’s opinion. To me, this is not education. It’s mavenism ( I just made that up ;-). Too many people rely on this system to make choices. It clouds their judgement and does nothing to help them learn their palettes and preferred food pairings. Don’t get me wrong. It has it’s place, but it should never be used as a definitive guide to selecting and buying wine. And it certainly isn’t education.

If you want a good idea of what wine education really looks like, I highly recommend Madelene Puckette’s blog at [Wine Folly](http://winefolly.com/). It is a virtual treasure trove of wine education for beginner and expert a like–and beautifully designed, as well. If you want to see what the experts reference, go to [Jancis Robinson’s website](http://www.jancisrobinson.com/). She is arguably the most respected expert and educator in the industry. Take a look, then test yourself with my Alexa apps. This kind of education is fun…trust me.

If you’re a reader, I recommend Karen McNeil’s [Wine Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Wine-Bible-Karen-MacNeil-ebook/dp/B00U0OBRAS/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1494096510&sr=1-3&keywords=wine). It’s probably the easiest reading of all the encyclopedia type wine guides. If you’re more into the “cocktail table book”, checkout the [World Atlas of Wine](https://www.amazon.com/World-Atlas-Wine-7th/dp/1845336895/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1494096865&sr=1-1&keywords=wine+atlas) by Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson. For you more nerdy types, I recommend Alan Young’s [Making Sense of Wine Tasting](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Sense-Wine-Tasting-Essential-ebook/dp/B003Z0BKME/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1494096655&sr=1-1&keywords=alan+young+wine+tasting).  Wine tasting is probably the most important part of your wine education and palette discovery. Thus, it will be the topic of my next wine product. Because, let’s face it, tasting wine is way more fun than reading about it.
