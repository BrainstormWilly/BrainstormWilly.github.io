### Exciting new changes for the YnoGuy.

Tomorrow I will be starting a new job with [Dry Creek Vineyard](http://www.drycreekvineyard.com)Â as Tasting Room Lead/Wine Educator. This move is somewhat bittersweet as I leave all the great people and wines at [Chateau St. Jean](http://www.chateaustjean.com). I've learned so much there in the last year and have many stories to tell. But, as you'll find out following this blog, my compassion for wine includes the business of wine. Family owned wineries like Dry Creek are increasingly rare competing inan industry that is heavily influenced by corporations and antiquated government regulation. In Sonoma Valley alone, in the last 20 years wineries have gone from 80% owner-operated to 20% as corporations gobble them up. Wine is an agricultural business and anyone who likes its product diversity and the American dream should support family-run vineyards and wineries. I'm excited to help DCV face its future challenges by educating its consumers on not only its wine, but its rich family story and history. If you're in Sonoma County, make your way to Dry Creek Valley and visit us near the vibrant town of Healdsburg...in Zinfandel country!

In addition, as of April 25th I have a new pin in my collection. I am now a Certified Specialist of Wine with the Society of Wine Educators. This is in addition to my Advanced Certificate with WSET. In my quest for more wine knowledge I intend to pursue Certified Wine Educator with SWE as my next educational challenge.

Finally, I want to announce my next wine country adventure. My wife and I will be traveling to Barcelona, Spain in September where I will be tasting and touring the famous wine regions of Penedes and Priorat. This, of course, will be a working vacation and I will be posting pics and posts as I go...the things I do for my career ;-)
