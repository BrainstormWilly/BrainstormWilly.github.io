### Customers, Members, Whatever

<img src="/images/bleat-2-banner.png" width="100%"><br>*“Nello, get out of the Dahlias!”*

It’s been a frustrating day. Bad enough handling an above average attendance, but every time I turn my back Nello is munching on our new Spring flowers. Our customers find this dance amusing, but if he destroys the garden I’m the one to blame.

*“You should try them, they’re delicious. These Dahl… Dall… what did yo…”*

*“NELLO!!”* Followed by the requisite foot stomp.

*“OK, OK. So those last customers seemed to enjoy themselves.”*

I roll my eyes. The old bad behavior distraction technique.

*“Yes, they were members from out of town. They come by once a year. I try to make sure they get the best out of it.”*

*“Customers, members, whatever…”*

It’s moments like this I wish we had horses instead of sheep.

*“Nello, I thought by now you understood the difference between a customer and a member.”*

*“Sure, members are in that thing you call a ‘club’”*

*“Uh huh, and why do you think they join our club?”*

*“Discounts... duh!”*

Hand to face.

*“Our discounts don’t make our wine cheap, you know. They’re cheaper alternatives out there.”*

*“Really!? Then why do they buy ours?”*

I could tell by his shocked look that Nello suddenly had a vision of his charmed life evaporating. I purposely had to pause and relish the moment.

*“Now you’re finally asking the right question. Customers become members only when they feel they’re a part of something. We are a family farm and winery. We don’t just make wine, we craft it. Each new vintage is an expression of what our land provides. Members know this isn’t easy and want to support it, as well as reap the bene… NELLO!!”*

*“Sorry, they’re just so tasty”*

*“To the pen!”*

*“So you said these members like our farm?”*

*“GO! NOW!”*

I’m not sure if Nello will ever understand the differences between members and customers. As a matter of fact, I think the whole concept of loyalty is lost on him. I seriously doubt he cares where his hay comes from. In reality, a lot of wine customers are much like Nello. To them wine is just another adult beverage to be consumed on appropriate occasions. Like on a dinner date, where ordering a White Claw may make an undesired impression. However, members are different. They don’t just CONSUME wine. They are on what I call a wine JOURNEY. To them wine is about discovery and the more they learn about it, the more they enjoy it. My job as a wine educator is to help them along…and by doing so hope to make our little winery a part of it. But my job is becoming increasingly difficult. In the next few editions Nello and I will have more discussions as to why, and what to do about it. Stay tuned.
