In my previous post I tried to explain the definition of a wine club, and the difference between a retail wine club and a winery wine club. In this post I will try to explain the evolution of the wine club and why they exist in the first place. The fact of the matter is wine clubs are now basically loyalty programs, but that's not how they started.

## A (Very) Brief History of Alcohol in America

It's 1933 and America's great experiment, Prohibition, is failing miserably. Americans now disapprove of the 19th Amendment by an overwhelming majority. Organized crime has become more brazen and incredibly wealthy distributing illegal hooch from Canada, Europe, and the Caribbean. Moonshiners are showing off their get-away cars in a new sport called "stock car" racing. Citizens are poisoning themselves with “bath tub” gin and wineries are selling unusually high amounts of "sacramental" wine. The federal government has had enough. However, Prohibition was a part of the Constitution and, as we currently know with the ACA, turning it back won't be easy. It will require another Amendment and many states are still quite satisfied with the status quo. Compromise will be necessary.

Reticent states insisted they should be able to control the flow of alcohol across their borders. Legally, interstate trade is protected under the Constitution–but these were desperate times. The solution came to be known as the [3 Tier system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution). It declared that alcohol production, distribution, and retail were to be separated entities giving states and their distributors full inventory control. Retailers would not be allowed to purchase alcohol directly from a producer, making the distributor a gatekeeper. It was a strange "tail wagging the dog" compromise that was hastily drafted for ratification, albeit wrought with loopholes and constitutional hypocrisy. Some states like Utah and Ohio chose to handle distribution as a government function. Other states restricted distributor licenses to just a handful. Subsequently, 80 years later the system [looks nothing like what was intended](https://fermentationwineblog.com/2018/09/a-corrupt-scheme-at-the-middle-of-the-american-wine-industry/) and [is straining in the face of corporate deregulation and the internet](https://winefolly.com/update/three-tier-system/).

## A (Very) Brief History of Wine in America

After the end of Prohibition wine was largely made in bulk by brands like Gallo, Inglenook, and Almaden. With so few producers making relatively few large volume labels, it was easy for distributors to carry virtually every wine made. However, by the mid 1960's small wineries in California like Robert Mondavi, Louis Martini, Beaulieu Vineyards, and others were producing small batch wines. Most of the country didn't take notice until the famous Paris Tasting of 1976 when California Cabernet and Chardonnay suddenly achieved world acclaim. Small wine producers started popping up everywhere–particularly in California, Oregon, New York, Virginia, and Washington where climate and soils were most suitable for vine growing. On the other hand, while the number of wine producers was exploding, the number of state distributors were doing the exact opposite. One of the loopholes of the 3 Tier system permits distributors to operate in multiple states, thus enabling mergers and acquisitions. A once small Florida distributor called [Southern Wine & Spirits](https://www.forbes.com/companies/southern-wine-spirits/#7787f1415a59) now controls the flow of alcohol in 35 states. The result: thousands of wineries trying to get a relative handful of distributors to carry their products.

Starting in the 1990's the wine industry reaction was if you can't beat them, join them. Wineries  began buying each other out and today [up to 50% of the U.S. wine market is controlled by just 10 wine conglomerates](https://winefornormalpeople.com/brands-owned-by-big-corporate-wineries-the-master-list-to-check-if-your-brand-is-independent-or-part-of-a-big-hulking-winery/) (including the 3 aforementioned pioneers). This still leaves most producers with production too small to be picked up by a distributor. Their solution, sell direct. Wineries choosing this option across state lines were, at first, operating illegally. However, states like CA, WA, OR, and NY starting making "reciprocal" agreements allowing direct sales of restricted quantities across state lines. Eventually, provisions of the 21st Amendment were challenged and today over 40 states now have some form of direct sales allowance.

## DTC Economics 101

For years, direct shipping was a necessity by the smallest producers who couldn't distribute. However, many larger wineries had tasting rooms and some of them were taking notice of how their Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) sales were affecting their bottom line. Let's do a little hypothetical wine math on a bottle of wine that sells for $25 via distribution:

* Production Cost: $5
* Distributor Share: $6
* Retailer Share: $7
* Taxes: $2
* Profit: $5

Now, let's try that as a tasting room sale:

* Production Cost: $5
* Taxes: $2
* Profit: $18

Admittedly, this is over-simplified and results will vary. It doesn’t include the costs of running a tasting room, but nor does it include the cost of marketing to distributors and retailers. Regardless, the bottom line is you have to sell roughly 3x more wine via distribution in order to match the profit from a tasting room. Originally, virtually all producers could find a distributor in most states regardless of their production. The ease and volume of distributed sales made tasting rooms an optional tourist novelty. This changed with increased competition. However, despite increases in consumer demand many producers found themselves being locked out of distribution. The survivors either drastically reduced production to match what they could sell locally and/or put more emphasis on mixing in DTC sales to make up the difference. Today, virtually all new small wineries cater to their local market and/or sell DTC exclusively–knowing that a distribution pipeline–for them–is more like a pipe dream.

## The Inevitable Collision

To say the least, distributors don't like direct sales. They view it as a loophole to what is their constitutional domain. They have fought it tooth-and-nail over the years through lobbyists and political contributions. However, consumer demand, producer frustration, and the enforcement of interstate trade laws have been slowly chipping away at their stronghold. Given their situation you would think they'd try to be more accommodating to small producers. In fact, again, they are doing just the opposite. They are shunning them in favor of working more exclusively with wine conglomerates. Why? They have mutually exclusive motivations. For conglomerates, starving small producers forces them to sell out, thus increasing their own portfolio. For distributors, dealing exclusively with conglomerates enables them to access larger portfolios without as much leg work and more wheeling-and-dealing. It's a win-win...except for consumers and retailers. Wine shops and restaurants are forced more-and-more into purchasing big brand wine, while in stores wine aisles are looking more like cereal aisles. Lots of pretty labels...from just a handful of corporations.

Consumers unite! Since I entered the wine biz 5 years ago formerly stalwart distribution states like Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and now Oklahoma have opened up to DTC sales. This is because consumers are increasingly demanding access to undistributed wines. As a percentage, [DTC sales](https://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=widc&widcDomain=dtc&widcYYYYMM=201808) are out-pacing [distributed sales](https://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=widc&widcDomain=siri&widcYYYYMM=201808) year-over-year. Wine clubs and internet sales are leading the charge. Why? Wine comes from a vineyard. Vineyards are only successful in certain places around the globe. Wine consumers should have access to any wine made from these vineyards regardless of where they live. Why should distributors be the ones to decide who gets what? Opponents will cite nonsense about teenage alcoholism and drunk driving. Really? Since when does an alcoholic order a $50 bottle of cabernet to have shipped to his home? Seriously, opposing DTC wine has nothing to do with alcoholism. Based on my observations, it's plain old corporate cronyism and greed. I encourage you to do what I do. Join a small winery club. It's expensive and shipping is a hassle, but it's hand crafted, delicious, and...well, just another way to stick it to the man!

In my final post on this subject I will discuss why small batch wines matter and how the craft beer boom may actually save the wine industry...if it doesn't kill it first.
